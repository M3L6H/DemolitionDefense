## Purpose

This project was created as a final project for the class EDS 130 at UCSD.

The goal of this project was to create a game as a gift for my elementary school mentee Victor.

## Dedication

This game is dedicated to Victor, my mentee for the Spring quarter of 2019.

Thank you, Victor, for being such an inspiration to me, and for being the wonderful student that you are.

You are very intelligent, kind, and thoughtful, and I believe that if you keep to your current path, you will achieve great things.

Don't forget the wonderful lessons Mrs. Guzman has taught you, and, if sometime later in life, we cross paths again, I look forward to seeing who you have become.
